# Flow Magic

Flow Magic is a cutting-edge open-source solution under active development as part of the Software Innovation Track at Oregon State University ([SI Lab](https://research.engr.oregonstate.edu/si-lab/)). It streamlines screen flow management for iOS developers, enabling the modification of the screen flow of apps via an intuitive web portal without any code changes.

## Getting Started

To begin with Flow Magic, you'll first need to integrate our SDK into your project. The SDK is available on GitHub [SDK GitHub link](https://github.com/KedarDhere/FlowMagic-SDK).

## How It Works

### Step 1: SDK Integration
Incorporate the Flow Magic SDK into your iOS application. The SDK is constructed using SwiftUI, ensuring effortless integration with your SwiftUI-based iOS applications.

### Step 2: Google Authentication
Authenticate using Google to access our dedicated web portal. Our platform ensures secure access by leveraging the trusted Google Authentication system.

### Step 3: Review Your Registered Applications
Post authentication, you can access all your registered applications from one place. This provides a unified platform to manage multiple applications.

### Step 4: Choose Application to Modify
Select the application that you wish to modify. Upon selection, the current screen flow of the application will be displayed, providing a clear understanding of the existing structure before you make changes.

### Step 5: Edit Screen Flow
Utilize our user-friendly drag-and-drop interface to edit your application's screen flow in real-time. Changes can be previewed immediately, removing the need to write or modify any code.

## Advantages of Using Flow Magic

1. **Expedite Time to Market:** Reduce the time spent on code modifications for screen flow alterations and speed up your application's development cycle.

2. **Facilitates A/B Testing:** Conduct effective A/B testing by offering an easy-to-use method to switch between different screen flows.

3. **No Extra Development Costs:** Lower your development expenses by removing the need for code modifications when changing screen flow.

## Our Technology Stack

1. **SDK:** Developed using SwiftUI for seamless integration with iOS applications.
2. **Web Portal:** Crafted using React and the React Flow Library to provide a smooth and responsive user interface.
3. **Server:** Our server is built with Node.js, enabling efficient and scalable data management.

Presently, Flow Magic is designed to support iOS applications. However, we're working towards extending our support to Android applications in the near future.
